Did you know that more than 70% of our planet is covered by water? While we’ve learned a lot about the land we live on, the underwater world remains largely a mystery. This is due to its vast size, high pressure, and harsh conditions.

But things are changing. In recent years, we’ve started using something called Wireless Sensor Networks (or WSNs for short) in various areas, including military and civilian applications. These networks can operate without human intervention and have brought about significant changes in these fields.

The success of WSNs has inspired researchers to explore their use underwater. This new field, known as Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), holds great promise for increasing our understanding of the underwater world.

Imagine a network of smart devices, called sensor nodes, that can work on their own and organize themselves. These devices are equipped with a special type of modem that uses sound to communicate and can be placed manually or randomly in different depths of an area underwater, whether it’s deep or shallow.

These sensor nodes pick up information from their surroundings and send this data through other nodes to nodes on the water surface, known as sink nodes. The sink nodes then send all the collected data to stations on land or at sea for analysis.

Using wireless sensor networks underwater is a bit like trying to have a conversation in a noisy room. It’s not easy and comes with its own set of challenges.

Firstly, high radio frequencies get absorbed quickly in water, and low radio frequencies need a really big antenna. Using light waves isn’t efficient either because they scatter in water and need a high level of accuracy at the point where the laser beams connect. Plus, the nodes (or points in the network) move around with the water current and don’t stay in one place. So, sound waves are the best way to communicate underwater.

But using sound waves brings its own problems, like delays in transmission, loss of data packets, high energy use, and low bandwidth.

Also, because of water currents, the sensor nodes that are placed at different depths can move around freely. This creates a network that changes a lot.

The network is also sparse because of the three-dimensional area, the cost of underwater equipment, and the changing network.

Lastly, we can’t use GPS underwater because high radio frequencies get absorbed quickly in water.

Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are unique. Because of this, the existing nodes and protocols used in Terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSNs) need to be adapted both in terms of hardware and software to be used in UWSNs.

This has led to new research in different areas of UWSNs. Several studies have been done on the basic layers of the network protocol stack. This includes the physical channel, MAC protocols, localization techniques, and routing.

One of the key challenges in UWSNs is routing a packet from an underwater sensor node to sink nodes on the water surface. While many studies have tried to address this problem, each has its own pros and cons.

So, there’s still a need to develop routing algorithms that use less energy and deliver a high number of packets.
